1) Setting up the Project:
    Create a new Node.js project using "npm init".
    Install TypeScript: npm install typescript --save-dev.

2) Dependencies for csv read
 npm i csv-parser

3) Running the Application:
    Compile the TypeScript code using "tsc".
    Run the generated JavaScript code using "node dist/index.js".

4) Add file to your root directory with name test_data.csv

#### Limitations:
1) Memory Usage: The current implementation loads the entire dataset into memory, which may not be efficient for very large datasets. For datasets with millions of rows, a streaming approach or batch processing might be more suitable.

2) Error Handling: The error handling in the current implementation is minimal. Improvements could be made to handle errors more gracefully, provide detailed error messages, and log errors to a file for reference.

3) Validation: While there's a basic file existence check, there is limited validation of the spreadsheet data. More robust validation mechanisms could be implemented to handle various data types, missing fields, or unexpected formats.

##### Suggestions for Improvement:
1) Streaming Processing: Implement a streaming approach to process the spreadsheet in chunks rather than loading the entire dataset into memory. This would reduce memory usage and allow processing large datasets efficiently.

2) Parallel Processing: For datasets with millions of rows, consider parallelizing the processing to improve performance. This could be achieved using Node.js's built-in cluster module or by using external tools for parallel processing.

3) Error Handling and Logging: Enhance error handling to provide informative error messages and implement logging to capture errors during processing. This would assist in identifying and addressing issues more effectively.

4) Configurability: Make the application more configurable, allowing users to specify input and output paths, adjust processing parameters, or select different processing modes.

5) Unit Testing: Implement unit tests to ensure the robustness and correctness of the code. This becomes crucial as the codebase grows, ensuring that changes do not introduce unexpected issues.

###### Changes for a Dataset with 5,000,000 Rows:
1) Batch Processing: Implement a batch processing approach where the dataset is processed in smaller chunks, reducing the load on memory and allowing for more efficient processing.

2) Distributed Computing: Consider using distributed computing frameworks (e.g., Apache Spark) for parallel and distributed processing of such large datasets, enabling scalability across multiple nodes.

3) Database Integration: Instead of storing all data in memory, integrate a database system to store and retrieve data efficiently. This could involve streaming data directly into a database or using a database for indexing and search operations.

4) Performance Monitoring: Implement performance monitoring to track resource usage, execution times, and bottlenecks. This would help in identifying areas for optimization and improving overall efficiency.

5) Optimized Algorithms: Review and optimize algorithms for processing efficiency, especially when dealing with a large number of rows. Evaluate and use algorithms and data structures that are well-suited for the specific requirements.
